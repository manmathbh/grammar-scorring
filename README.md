#  Grammar Scoring Engine

üéôÔ∏è A voice-based ML app that predicts grammar fluency score (0‚Äì5) from spoken audio samples using audio feature extraction (MFCC) and regression modeling.  
Built with **Gradio**, deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces**, and trained with real audio samples.

##  Project Overview

The **Grammar Scoring Engine** is a machine learning project that leverages audio signal processing and regression modeling to evaluate grammar fluency in spoken English. 

Users are prompted to **speak naturally for 45‚Äì60 seconds**, and the model provides an objective **grammar score between 0 and 5**, based on audio features.
